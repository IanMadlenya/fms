	<h1>The Fundamental Theorem<br/> of Asset Pricing</h1>
	<h3 style="text-align: right;">Keith A. Lewis</h3>
	<p>
		This theorem is the foundation for pricing, hedging, and managing the risk
		of derivative securities.  Unfortunately, it has become so math-encrusted
		as to be completely unintelligible to traders, risk managers, and even
		to most quants.

	</p>
	<p>
		The statement of the theorem is "There should be no sequence of final
		payoffs of admissible integrands, \(f_n = (H^n\cdot S)_\infty\), such
		that the negative parts \(f_n^-\) tend to zero uniformly and such that
		\(f_n\) tends almost surely to a \([0,\infty]\)-valued function \(f_0\)
		satisfying \(P[f_0 > 0] > 0\)."  And if you can make heads or tails out
		of that, my hat is off to you.
		<!--
		I have a PhD in math and that the unit ball in \(L^\infty\) not having
		any non-trivial weak\(^*\)-closed subsets and requires the mathematical
		gyrations required to get the Hahn-Banach theorem working in this
		unfortunate situation.
		-->
	</p>
	<p>
		If you couldn't care less about this sort of mathematical obfuscation,
		allow me to introduce you to a version of the theorem that is very easy
		to understand and can be applied to solving real world problems.

	</p>
	<h2>Finance</h2>
	<p>
		The simple mathematics required for a complete theory are provided below.
		For now we will play with mathematical symbols in a way that hopefully
		reflects your intuition about how financial markets work.  Later we will
		make this mathematically rigorous and consider the problem of implementing
		the mathematics on a computer.

	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Trading</h3>
		Trades can happen at <em>times</em> \(t_0 < t_1 < t_2 < \dots\).
		The <em>price</em> of all market instruments available for trading
		at time \(t_j\) is the
		vector \(X_j\). Market instruments pay <em>cash flows</em> \(C_j\) at
		time \(t_j\) associated with owning them: bonds pay coupons, stocks
		pay dividends, spot FX trades pay the difference in interest rates
		in the currency pair.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can <em>trade</em> the vector \(\Gamma_j\)
		in market instruments at time \(t_j\) and build a
		<em>position</em> \(\Delta_j = \sum_{i\le j}\Gamma_i\).  If you actually
		do this, your broker will send you <em>account</em> statements. At time
		\(t_j\) you will see \(A_j = \Delta_{j-1}\cdot C_j - \Gamma_j\cdot X_j\)
		show up on it: you get all the cash flows associated with your
		existing position and have to pay for the trades you execute.
		The <em>value</em> of your position at \(t_j\) is
		\(V_j = \Delta_j\cdot X_j\), assuming you could liquidate it
		at prevailing market prices.
	</p>
	<h3>Arbitrage</h3>
	<p>
		If you can find trades \(\Gamma_j\) that eventually close out your
		position with \(A_0 > 0\) and \(A_j\ge0\) for \(j>0\), that is
		arbitrage. You make money up front and never lose until you unwind
		your position.
	</p>
	<h3>Models</h3>
	<p>
		The job of a quant is to come up with models of prices and cash flows
		that are arbitrage free and allow for possible price movements.
		They have been falling down on the job of giving a good measure of
		how bad their models are. Every trader knows no hedge is perfect,
		the real question is how imperfect is it.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <em>Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing</em> is that a model is arbitrage
		free if, and only if, there exist positive <em>pricing measures</em> \(\Pi_j\) such
		that
		\[
		X_j\Pi_j = (C_{j+1} + X_{j+1})\Pi_{j+1}|_j\tag{1}
		\]
		For now, think of \(\Pi_j\) as the discount to time \(t_j\)
		and read the funny \(|_j\) thing at
		the end as 'given information available at time \(t_j\)'.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following trivial calculation is the key to understanding
		derivative securities.

	</p>
	<p>
		\begin{align*}
		V_j\Pi_j &= \Delta_j\cdot X_j\Pi_j\\
		&= \Delta_j\cdot(C_{j+1} + X_{j+1})\Pi_{j+1}|_j\\
		&= (A_{j+1} + \Gamma_{j+1}\cdot X_{j+1}
		+ \Delta_j\cdot X_{j+1})\Pi_{j+1}|_j\\
		&= (A_{j+1} + \Delta_{j+1}\cdot X_{j+1})\Pi_{j+1}|_j\\
		&= (A_{j+1} + V_{j+1})\Pi_{j+1}|_j\\
		\end{align*}
		Let's put that on a line by itself and a number it.
		\[
		V_j\Pi_j (A_{j+1} + V_{j+1})\Pi_{j+1}|_j \tag{2}
		\]
		In equation (2) the value \(V_j\) acts like a price and the account
		\(A_j\) acts like a cash flow in equation (1). You can create synthetic
		instruments by dynamically trading \(\Gamma_j\).
		This is the skeleton key to derivatives.

	</p>
	<p>
		By induction,
		\[
		V_j\Pi_j = (\sum_{j\lt i\le k}A_i\Pi_i + V_k\Pi_k)|_j.
		\]
	</p>
	<p>
		We can multiply the \(\Pi_j\) by any positive number so we
		can and do assume \(\Pi_0 = 1\).
		If \((\Gamma_j)\) eventually close
		out then \(V_0 = \sum_{i>0} A_i\Pi_i|_0\).
		If \(A_i\ge 0\) for \(i > 0\) then \(V_0\ge 0\). Since
		\(V_0 = \Delta_0\cdot X_0 = \Gamma_0\cdot X_0 = -A_0\)
		we have \(A_0\le 0\). This proves the easy direction of the
		FTAP.
	</p>
	<h3>Derivatives</h3>
	<p>
		A <em>derivative security</em> is an agreement between two
		counterparties on a sequence of payments. A <em>buyer</em>
		pays the <em>seller</em> to provide payments
		\((A_j)_{j=1}^n\) at corresponding times \((t_j)_{j=1}^n\).
		<em><b>If</b></em> it is possible to find
		trades \(\Gamma_j\) that close out (say \(\Delta_n = 0\))
		with \(A_j = \Delta_{j-1}\cdot C_j - \Gamma_j\cdot X_j\)
		then the cost of the initial hedge is
		\[
		V_0 = \sum_{i=1}^n A_i\Pi_i|_0.\tag{3}
		\]
		Equation (3) is the formal way to express that the value
		of a derivative is the sum of the discounted cash flows.
		Note there are no probability measures, much less expected
		values, involved.
	</p>
	<p>
		But how do we find such \(\Gamma_j\)?
		Since \(V_0 = \Delta_0\cdot X_0\) we have
		\(\Gamma_0 = \Delta_0 = dV_0/dX_0\) so we know the initial
		hedge. At any time \(t_j\) the same prescription
		holds: \(\Delta_j = dV_j/dX_j\). The trade at time \(t_j\)
		to hedge the position is \(\Gamma_j = \Delta_j - \Delta_{j-1}\).
	</p>
	<p>
		Now you understand the choice of notation for trades and position.
	</p>
	<p>
		So far, so easy. What's the catch? The catch is there is
		no guarantee that \(A_j = \Delta_{j-1}\cdot C_j - \Gamma_j\cdot X_j\).
		It is only true <em><b style="font-size:110%">if</b></em> we can find a trading
		strategy to replicate the payoffs.
		The left hand side is specified by the contract. The right hand
		side follows from the delta hedging prescription above.
		The difference is your \(t_j\)-ly profit and loss.
		This is where quants have been falling down on the job.
		It is absolutely crucial for risk managers to understand
		how big that <em><b style="font-size:120%">if</b></em> is.

	</p>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, in the classical theory certain mathematical
		artifacts of Brownian motion have blurred the true picture.
		Black-Scholes/Merton continuous time hedging allows mathematicians
		to ignore the fact that no market is complete.
	</p><p>
		There is a so-called Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing:
		<em><b style="font-size:130%">If</b></em>
		markets are
		complete then the pricing measures are unique. I have a very
		short mathematical proof of this: \(A\) implies \(B\) is
		true if \(A\) is false. Q.E.D.
	</p>
	<p>
		The difficult direction of the FTAP is that no arbitrage implies
		pricing measures exist. But who cares? As we will soon see,
		it is very simple to
		write down pricing measures in practice.
		There is no need for fancy mathematics to prove they exist.
		<!--
		Steve Ross used the the Hahn-Banach
		theorem in 1976 for that and started a small cottage industry
		in figuring out a mathematically rigorous way of doing that.
		But who cares? I don't know of any quant who has ever used the
		Hahn-Banach theorem to come up with pricing measures.
		In fact, it is very easy to produce pricing measures
		so why bother proving they exist.
		</p>
		-->
	<p>
		A disparaging characterization of the current state of 
		affairs might be that
		quants cook up models, but keep fiddling with (also known as
		recalibrating) them every day, or even every minute.  Traders press
		a button to get the value \(V_0 = \sum A_j\Pi_j|_0\) where the \(A_j\) 
		are specified by the term sheet, then add some monotonically increasing 
		function of how irritating the gamma profile is to them.
		Risk managers then proceed to empirically
		verify Taylor's theorem every day to "explain" the profit and loss.

		<!--
		<p>
		The ideal would be to find a model that gets calibrated once, then
		works forever. If stock prices were indeed geometric Brownian motion
		with constant volatility, every observed price would simply improve
		the precision of the volatility parameter until we got bored of adding
		decimal places. Instead we are left to constantly fiddle with it because
		the model is misspecified.
		</p>
		<p>
		Traders are the best (short term) risk managers. They understand the
		real risk must take into account the trading strategy be used
		in the hedge.
		</p>
		-->
		<h2>Mathematics</h2>
	<p>
		In this section we map the financial intuition above to concrete
		mathematics. What, exactly, is a price? And how does the
		funny \(|_j\) thing represent 'given information available at time \(t_j\)'?
	</p>
	<p>
		I should warn fellow mathematicians that I am going to take away your pacifiers
		and dump you out of your crib. No \(L^\infty\) spaces with weak\(^*\)
		topologies or local martingales are needed here. Leave your
		precious toys in their boxes. High school math is all that is required.
	</p>
	<h3>Partitions</h3>
	<p>
		A <em>partition</em> is the mathematical way of
		describing partial information. A partition of a set
		is a collection of disjoint subsets who's union
		equals the entire set. Each set in the partition is an 
		<em>atom</em> of the partition.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let \(\Omega\) be the set of all possible <em>outcomes</em> in a model.
		To model rolling
		a die, the set \(\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\) will do. To
		represent the partial information that we only know if
		the roll was even or odd we can use the partition
		\(\{\{1,3,5\},\{2,4,6\}\}\). We don't know what the
		roll is, but we know which of these two sets it belongs to.
		Perfect knowledge is represented by the partition of
		singleton sets: \(\{\{1\},\dots,\{6\}\}\).
		Complete lack of knowledge is the partition having
		only one subset: \(\{\Omega\}\).
	</p>
	<p>
		In mathematical finance the set of outcomes can be quite
		large. In the Black-Scholes/Merton model \(\Omega = C[0,\infty)\)
		- the space of continuous functions on the non-negative real
		numbers. These represent the possible trajectories of the
		log of the stock price.
	</p>
	<p>
		Algorithmic trading strategies have \(\Omega\) that contain historical
		prices or the text of financial publications, or even social media data.
		It could also specify the possible trajectories of every market traded
		instrument.  Mathematics allows you to think very big
		even though it might be expensive and impractical to implement.
		Big data and multicore processing is make what was once impossible
		into a commodity.

	</p>
	<h3>Measures</h3>
	<p>
		A <em>measure</em> is a function from a partition to the
		real numbers, \(\RR\). If you know the usual mathematical
		definition of a measure, just extend this to the
		algebra of sets generated by the partition. It obviously
		satisfies the condition that the measure of the
		union of two disjoint sets is the sum of their individual
		measures. If you are hoping to hear about \(\sigma\)-algebras
		I'm afraid you will be disappointed. We have no need for
		dainty measure theoretic notions required to prove theorems
		about interchanging limits.
	</p>
	<p>
		A function on \(\Omega\) is <em>measurable</em> if it is
		constant on each atom &ndash; it only depends on the
		information encoded by the partition.
	</p>
	<h3>Filtrations</h3>
	<p>
		Given times \(t_0 < t_1 < \cdots\), a <em>filtration</em> is an
		increasing sequence of partitions \(\PP_0\subseteq\PP_1\subseteq\cdots\).
		The partition \(\PP_j\) represents the information available at time
		\(t_j\). A sequence of functions, \((X_j)\), on \(\Omega\) is <em>adapted</em>
		to the filtration if each \(X_j\) is \(\PP_j\)-measurable.

	</p>
	<h3>Bounded Functions</h3>
	<p>
		We represent prices, cash flows, and trades using
		bounded functions,
		\[
		B(\Omega) = \{f\colon\Omega\to\RR\mathop{:}
		\max_{\omega\in\Omega} |f(\omega)| < \infty \}.
		\]
	</p>
	<p>
		There is no fixed bound on the size of the function, it just
		can't keep growing without limit. Just like in the real world.
		Denote the space of bounded \(\PP\) measurable functions by
		\(B(\Omega,\PP)\). The functions can also be vector-valued
		\(B(\Omega,\PP,\RR^m)\). (Note: mathematicians use \(\sup\), short
		for supremum, instead of \(\max\) in the above definition since
		there may be no \(\omega\) for which equality holds.)
	</p>
	<h4>Duality</h4>
	<p>
		The <em>dual</em> of a vector space, \(V\), is the set of all
		linear functionals, \(V^*\), on \(V\). For example, we can identify
		the dual of \(\RR^m\) with itself as follows.
	</p>
	<p>
		Given a linear functional \(\pi\colon\RR^m\to\RR\)
		let \(p_i = \pi(e_i)\) where
		\(e_i\) has \(1\) in the \(i\)-th position as its only
		non-zero entry. We can write any vector
		\(v = (v_1,\dots,v_m) = \sum_i v_i e_i\) so
		\[
		\pi(v) = \pi(\sum_i v_i e_i) = \sum_i v_i \pi(e_i) = \sum_i v_i p_i.
		\]
		This shows we can identify the dual of \(\RR^m\) with itself
		via \(\pi\mapsto (p_1,\dots,p_m)\) and that the <em>dual pairing</em>
		\(\pi(v) = \langle v, \pi\rangle = v\cdot p\) is the
		<em>dot product</em>
	</p>

	<p>
		Note: if you know something about vector spaces you will realize
		we could use any basis, not just the special basis \(\{e_i\}\).
	</p>
	<p>
		If in addition \(V\) is an algebra, i.e. has a product that satisfies the
		distributive law with vector addition, then we can define a product
		as follows. Given
		\(v\in V\) and \(\pi\in V^*\) define \(v\pi\) by \(v\pi(u) =\langle
		u,v\pi\rangle = \langle uv,\pi\rangle = \pi(uv)\) for any \(u\in V\). This is a
		perfectly fine linear functional on \(V\), hence belongs to \(V^*\).
	</p>

	<h3>Finitely Additive Measures</h3>
	<p>
		The vector space <em>dual</em> of \(B(\Omega)\)
		is \(B(\Omega)^* = ba(\Omega)\), the space of all finitely
		additive measures on \(\Omega\). The dual pairing
		is given by integrating a function against a measure:
		\(\Pi(X) = \langle X,\Pi\rangle = \int_\Omega X\,d\Pi\).
	</p>
	<p>
	We are now in a position to give rigorous definitions:
	the functions \(X_j\), \(C_j\), and \(\Gamma_j\)
	belong to \(B(\Omega,\PP_j,\RR^m)\). The measures \(\Pi_j\)
	belong to \(ba(\Omega,\PP_j)\). Hence the equation
	\[
	X_j\Pi_j = (C_{j+1} + X_{j+1})\Pi_{j+1}|_{\PP_j}
	\]
	involves multiplying vector-valued bounded functions by finitely additive
	measures so each side is a vector-valued finitely additive measure. The
	funny \(|_j\) thing is simply restricting the \(\PP_{j+1}\) measure on
	the right-hand side to the subset \(\PP_j\subseteq\PP_{j+1}\).
	(Recall that if we have a function \(f\colon X\to Y\) and \(U\subseteq X\), then
	\(f|_U\colon U\to Y\) is the <em>restriction</em> of the function
	\(f\) to the subset \(U\).)

	</p>
	<p>
		That is the complete theory required for the Fundamental Theory
		of Asset Pricing. Now let's start using it.
	</p>

	<h3>Black-Scholes/Merton Model</h3>
	<p>
		Let \(P\) be Wiener measure on \(\Omega = C[0,\infty)\),
		\(B_t\colon\Omega\to\RR\). \(B_t(\omega) =\omega(t)\)
		is Brownian motion, and \(\FF_t\) is the smallest
		algebra making all \(B_s\) measurable for \(s\le t\).

		Recall \(M_t = e^{-\sigma^2t/2 + \sigma B_t}\) is a martingale,
		i.e., \(M_s = E[M_t|\FF_s]\) for \(s\le t\).
	</p>
	<p>
		The B-S/M model has two instruments, a bond and a stock. Their
		prices are \(X_t = (R_t, S_t) = (e^{rt},se^{(r - \sigma^2/2)t + \sigma B_t})\),
		there are no cash flows, so \(C_t = (0,0)\) for all \(t\).
		Using the martingale property above and the fact
		\(M_sP|_{\FF_s} = (M_tP)|_{\FF_s}\) for \(s\le t\) shows 
		\(\Pi_t = e^{-rt}P|_{\FF_t}\)
		are pricing measures. We can then use equation (3) above to
		price, say, an European option paying \(\phi(S_t)\) at time \(t\):
		\(V_0 = \phi(S_t)e^{-rt}P(\Omega) = e^{-rt}E[\phi(S_t)]\).
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice there is no need for Ito's lemma, self-financing conditions,
		partial differential equations, or the Hahn-Banach theorem.
		This approach has the
		pedagogical advantage of bypassing the fairly advanced mathematical
		scaffolding required in the classical theory. It also pays homage
		to the idea that won Scholes and Merton their well-deserved
		Nobel Prize. Why introduce a drift term you don't need and
		a "real world" measure that gets immediately discarded?
	</p>
	<p>
		This immediately generalizes to any martingale \((M_t)\).
		Let \(X_t = (R_t,S_t) = (e^{rt},e^{rt}M_t)\) and
		\(\Pi_t = e^{-rt}P|_{\FF_t}\). Indeed, \(M_t\) can be vector-valued,
		and since constants are martingales there is no need to single
		out the bond. Stochastic discounts independent of \(M_t\) are
		similarly easy to incorporate.
		See, I told you there were lots of pricing measures.
	</p>

	<h3>Finite Models</h3>
	<p>
		Just as modeling prices by bounded functions is no restriction
		when it comes to real-world models, assuming a finite number
		of possible outcomes is no restriction when it comes to models
		that can be implemented on a computer. After all, there are
		only \(10^{80}\) elementary particles in the observable universe.
	</p>
	<p>
		Given an atom \(A_j\in\PP_j\), let \(\{A_j\}\) be a slightly abusive
		use of notation for the set of atoms
		in \(\PP_{j+1}\) that are contained in \(A_j\). The no arbitrage
		condition becomes
		\[
		X_jP_j(A_j) = \sum_{A_{j+1}\in\{A_j\}} (X_{j+1} + C_{j+1})P_{j+1}(A_{j+1})
		\]
		Assume as in the previous example that the pricing measures are given.
		This provides constraints on prices and cash flows. Ignoring cash flows
		for the moment, this formula has \(m\times \#\PP_j\) equations
		and \(m\times \#\PP_{j+1}\) unknowns, so it
		is, in general, highly under-determined.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even given prices and cash flows, it is exponential in the number of
		computations, but there is a general technique to turn this into
		a quadratic law.
	</p>

	<h4>Multinomial Model</h4>
	<p>
		Fix a finite set \(\Lambda\subset\RR\) and probability measure \(P_0\)
		on this set. Let \(\Omega = \Lambda^n\) with product measure and define
		\(W_j(\omega) = \omega_1 + \cdots + \omega_j\).

	<p>
		For \(\Lambda = \{-1,1\}\) and \(P_0(\{\pm 1\}) = 1/2\),
		this is just random walk for a <em>binomial model</em>.
		For \(\Lambda = \{-\sqrt{3},0,\sqrt{3}\}\) with probabilities
		\(P_0(\{0\}) = 2/3\) and \(P_0(\{\pm 1\}) = 1/6\)
		we have the <em>trinomial model</em>. (Note
		\(E\Lambda^2 = EB_1^2\), and \(E\Lambda^4 = EB_1^4\) where
		\(B_1\) is Brownian motion at time \(1\).)

	</p>
	<p>
		If we only consider prices and cash flows that are a function of
		\(W_j\) the number of constraints and calculations become
		manageable. For the binomial model we get two equations and
		two unknowns so we have unique solutions. For trinomial
		models we have two equations and three unknowns.
		Assuming we have efficient means of computing
		\(\Pi_j(\{W_j = k\})\), which we do for binomial and trinomial models,
		this reduces the number of calculations to \(O(n^2)\). 
	</p>

	<h2>Remarks</h2>
	<p>
		But what about American options? These too can be handled in
		this framework. The option buyer can specify a <em>stopping time</em>,
		i.e., a function \(T\colon\Omega\to\{t_j\}\) with the property
		\(\{T = t_j\}\) is \(\PP_j\) measurable for each \(j\). You
		can exercise at \(t_j\) based only on the information available
		at that time. The pricing formula becomes
		\[
			V_0 = \phi(X_{\min\{T,t_n\}})\Pi_{\min\{T,t_n\}}|_{\PP_0},
		\]
		where \(\phi(x)\) is the payoff of the option that expires at \(t_n\).
	</p>
	<p>
		To model bonds that are both putable and callable, the buyer and
		seller each have their own stopping times and the value is again
		calculated by using pricing measures weighted by the payoffs these
		stopping times result in.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have sidestepped the question of determining the optimal stopping
		time. This model provides all the knobs required to faithfully
		describe what can occur. For mortgage backed securities
		it is well-known that participants do not refinance optimally. 
		We want to be able to model that too. Optimizing stopping
		times is a separate consideration.
	</p>
	<p>
		This short write-up does not systematically address the question
		of the risk involved when contractually specified \(A_j\) are
		hedged using \(\Delta_j = dV_j/dX_j\). One can still look at
		the gamma profile \(\Gamma_j = \Delta_j - \Delta_{j-1}\), or
		consider mean squared error such as
		\[
		\langle [A_j - (\Delta_{j-1}\cdot C_j - \Gamma_j\cdot X_j)]^2,\Pi_j\rangle.
		\]
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are nervous about the the notation \(dV_j/dX_j\), it is just
		shorthand for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_derivative">
		Fr&eacute;chet derivative</a>.
	</p>
	<!--
	<p>
	The sample space of the \(n\)-step binomial model is
	\(\Omega = \{-1,1\}^n\) and we let \(P\) be uniform
	measure on \(\Omega\), so \(P(\{\omega\}) = 1/2^n\)
	for each \(\omega\in\Omega\).
	Define the <em>random walk</em>
	\(W_k(\omega) = \omega_1 + \cdots + \omega_k\).

	Define the sets
